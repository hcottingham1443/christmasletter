      Hello!
      <br>
      <br>
      Welcome to the 2020 edition of the Cottingham Christmas letter. If you’re here, it means you figured out how to use the QR code included with our Christmas card, a gamble I took in honor of the many restaurants and services trading in their traditional paper menus for the virtual variety.

    How ironic that after four years of trying to squeeze all my thoughts and our family updates onto an 8x11 sheet of paper, the year I have literal virtual unlimited space is the year that I have the least to write. One draft of this letter just said “Dear friends and family: What the hell was that?" 
      <br>
      <br>
      However, despite the many cancelled travels, in person classes, business trips, church services, concerts, weddings... this is honestly getting depressing.... ok sorry, despite many cancelled and postponed events of 2020, we still have milestones to share and celebrations to recap. Let's dive in!
