      Hello!
      <br>
      <br>
      Welcome to the 2020 edition of the Cottingham Christmas letter. If you’re here, it means you figured out how to use the QR code included with our Christmas card, a gamble I took in honor of the many restaurants and services trading in their traditional paper menus for the virtual variety.
      <br>
      <br>
      How ironic that after four years of trying to squeeze all my thoughts and our family updates onto an 8x11 sheet of paper, the year I have literal virtual unlimited space is the year that I have the least to write. One draft of this letter just said “Dear friends and family: What the hell was that?" 
      <br>
      <br>
      However, despite the many cancelled and postponed events of 2020, we still have milestones to share and celebrations to recap. Ben and Mom both graduated, Evan got married, Carrie bought a house, I bought a couch. Huge year. In fact somehow this ended up being my longest letter ever. No offense taken if you decide not to read the whole thing, that’s why I put myself first. Let's dive in!
      <br>

      The most exciting thing I did in 2020 happened in the first few minutes. Picture it: the 52nd floor Sky Garden, Bangkok, Thailand. A New Year’s Eve I’ll never forget followed by a spectacular two week trip around the country visiting Chaing Mai and Phuket. I remember thinking “wow there’s no way the rest of the year could live up to this'' and I was <i>correct</i>. All joking aside, as tough as this year has been for many of us (take care of your mental health, people!) many bright spots included another year in Atlanta (the first time I haven’t moved in a calendar year in… forever) loved ones moving closer, decorating my apartment (hellloooooo new couch I love you), picking up the piano again,  tele-working hard, and going viral on Reddit for my Moira Rose Halloween Costume. Much to be thankful for.

      In August, Carrie and Matthew closed on their first home in Salt Lake City, a mere 30 minutes from the slopes and a few hours from the 250 foot waterfalls they like to repel down in their spare time. Between tending to the garden and organizing “the gear room” which is exactly what you’re imagining, our adventure duo found themselves busy with plenty to do at home this year. Carrie received a promotion and leads a team of 7 who I’m told like to troll her with their Zoom backgrounds, so they seem like good people. Per requirements of his new job consulting on marine equipment (think oil rig) Matt gained his <i>underwater helicopter escape certification </i> which is both horrifying and reassuring. They continue to love the Mountain West but do miss us dearly and continue to swear they’re coming back… eventually.

      Ben was probably the biggest trooper of us all having his senior year go virtual post Spring Break in March. He graduated in May from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor’s in Supply Chain, a Bachelor’s in Marketing, and a minor in Sports Management. After a summer delivering pizzas in Dad’s ‘69 Cadillac Coupe DeVille (because why not) he headed up to our nation’s capital to start his … wait for it … <i>rotational leadership development program </i> (Lisa is officially 4/4) with Sonepar, a distributor of electrical equipment. We’re keeping our fingers crossed for future travel to HQ in Paris, but love that Ben gets to live close to family in the DC area.

      And now, introducing, for the first time in this letter: Mr. and Mrs. Cameron and Evan Powers!  We celebrated our favorite Powers Couple in February in what was probably the last normal wedding of the year. The bride stunned in a white gown and accessories from her late TooMama, completing the winter look flawlessly. Cameron was handsome and gallant, and it was a party that will go down in the books. Following a honeymoon in Costa Rica, Evan and Cameron spent their first year as a married couple in their home in Greenville. Quarantine activities included gardening (if you were lucky enough to see Evan this summer, you probably got a tomato as a parting gift) and turning their garage into a humble home gym. The two remain at GE Power in Greenville and I can ping them on work chat whenever I want.

      In addition to throwing a beautiful wedding with so many friends and family, and surviving a year which brought challenges enough for any mother, Mom had a major achievement of her own in October. After starting her graduate degree at Rutgers in 1985, mom finished her Masters a mere 420 months later at Aquinas Institute of Theology, 42 months before she qualified for Medicare, a personal goal. Seriously though, anyone who has talked to my mom in the last two years knows how hard she has worked towards her Masters in Healthcare Mission and how much she deserves this degree. I am absolutely in awe of her dedication and determination to meet her goal and can confidently say that we are <i>all</i> so stinkin proud of Master Mom. 
      <br>
      <br>
      While thrilled to once again have mom’s undivided attention, Dad has also found a personal assistant in Alexa, who not only plays music but answers his most detailed sports trivia questions. Sure he’s about three years late to this ball game, but that’s what Quarantine is all about - discovering new things that you never had time for … or just never noticed because you were too busy living your life. For example, I am driven crazy daily by the fact that my wall art is hung just slightly too high. If I wasn’t home all the time I never would’ve noticed. Never. Ever. Ok sorry back to Dad. In addition to dodging covid closure with Evan’s wedding, he and mom were probably among the last visitors to the Biltmore’s Downton Abbey exhibit before the world shut down. See: their selfie on the back of the card. Dad continues to love his job, remains so proud of his family’s accomplishments this year and is patiently waiting <del>for grandkids</del> to travel again.

      Well, there you have it folks. My 6th (!!!) annual Cottingham Christmas letter. In the time I’ve been writing these we’ve added two new last names and graduated three kids from college. Three new houses, countless Cottingham moves around the country, two presidential elections and now we can add a global pandemic. What a year, what a life, thank you for reading the highlight reel each December. Remember to take care of yourself, prioritize your health (both physical and mental) oh and if you never got around to watching Tiger King what are you doing? Hoping for a less dramatic 2021 but with just as much to celebrate. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Lots of love, 
      <br>
      <br>
